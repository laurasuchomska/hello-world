# hello-world
this is the beginning of the new me.
After searching for a long time, I have finally found the career path that I want to pursue for the rest of my life. 
Here I am and going nowhere! bite me! 
I like cycling, boxing, and learning new languages - totally useful skills, hey! I also like sushi, I can eat ridiculous amounts of sushi.
Moreover, I love my little doggie Lola. She is a Frenchie, but more like a keyring rottweiler. When she barks, she sounds French though!
