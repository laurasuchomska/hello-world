after searching for a long time, I have finally found the career path Iwant to pursue for the rest of my life. 
here I am and going nowhere! bit me! 
I like cycling, boxing, learning new languages - totally useful skill, hey! I also like sushi, I can eat ridiculous amounts of sushi
I love my little doggie Lola. She is a Frenchie, but more like a keyring rottweiler. When she barks, she sounds French though
